				<h2>HISTORY OF THE DOCUMENT</h2>
				<p>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly 
				on 10 December 1948, was the result of the experience of the Second World War. With the end 
				of that war, and the creation of the United Nations, the international community vowed never 
				again to allow atrocities like those of that conflict happen again. World leaders decided to 
				complement the UN Charter with a road map to guarantee the rights of every individual everywhere. 
				The document they considered, and which would later become the Universal Declaration of Human 
				Rights, was taken up at the first session of the General Assembly in 1946.  The Assembly reviewed 
				this draft Declaration on Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms and transmitted it to the Economic 
				and Social Council "for reference to the Commission on Human Rights for consideration . . . in its 
				preparation of an international bill of rights." The Commission, at its first session early in 1947, 
				authorized its members to formulate what it termed "a preliminary draft International Bill of Human 
				Rights". Later the work was taken over by a formal drafting committee, consisting of members of the 
				Commission from eight States, selected with due regard for geographical distribution.</p>
